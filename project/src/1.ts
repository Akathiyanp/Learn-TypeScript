// Primitive Types

let msg1:string = "hello"; //explicit [not needed]

let msg2 = "hello" //implicit [automatically find the type of the variable contain string datatype]

//when to use explicit 


let x : number;

x = -Infinity

y = 67.4

let z : number;

z =  0;

let myName : string;

myName = 'akathiyan'

let result = null;  // null = empty or non-existent

let result2 = undefined //undefined = a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value

let result3 : number | undefined  = undefined  // | is union operator 

result3 = 2
// result3 = 'hi'

//void is used when you're returning nothing from a function 
//never is used when we explicitly define that a function never returns
